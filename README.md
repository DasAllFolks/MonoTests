# MonoTests
Quick demo project demonstrating how to use NUnit with Mono/C#.

I created this project as a quick proof of concept for how to
integrate [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org) with a Mono/C# project
(at this time, there unfortunately doesn't appear to be much
"canonical" documentation available on this subject).

Many thanks to [Luke Wickstead](https://lukewickstead.wordpress.com/)
for his [excellent blog post](https://lukewickstead.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/dotnetonlinux-day2-nunit/)
which helped make this project a reality.
